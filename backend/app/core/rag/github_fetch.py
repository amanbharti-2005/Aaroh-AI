"""
app/core/rag/github_fetch.py

Minimal utility: takes a GitHub repo URL, downloads it as a ZIP, and
extracts it to a local temp folder. This is the SMALLEST possible
version of "Repository Intelligence" — just enough to hand a real
folder to ingest_repository() for testing.

This is NOT the full Repository Analysis Agent (folder structure
summaries, git status, AST parsing, framework detection, README
parsing) — that's a bigger, separate piece, and per your team's
proposal it's Member 3's scope, not RAG. This file only exists so
YOU can test Repository RAG against real external repos instead of
only your own code.
