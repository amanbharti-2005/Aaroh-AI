app/core/rag/report_generator.py

Generates the actual content for the "Project Health Report" — the
piece that was missing. Report.py's router can already SAVE scores,
but nothing produced them. This does.

Uses Repository RAG to gather relevant code context, then asks Gemini
to return STRUCTURED scores (not prose) so they can go straight into
the Report table's numeric columns.
