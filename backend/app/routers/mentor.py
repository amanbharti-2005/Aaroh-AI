"""
app/routers/mentor.py
 
Exposes the full RAG + Groq loop over HTTP, AND saves every question
and answer to the database — so chat history actually persists and
the frontend's AI Mentor Chat page can load past conversations.
 
Uses ask_hybrid() so answers are grounded in BOTH the general
engineering knowledge base AND the specific repo the user uploaded
for this project (repo_id == str(project_id), matching the key
repository_rag.ingest_repository() was called with during upload).
If no repo has been ingested for this project yet (e.g. an idea-only
"text"/"voice" project), repo_chunks will just come back empty and
the answer falls back to general engineering knowledge — it never
errors out because of a missing repo.
 
Follows the same auth + DB pattern as project.py / repo.py:
Depends(get_db) for the database session, Depends(get_current_user)
for the logged-in user's identity.
